\textcolor{red}{Rough suggestion for structure we decided on:
\\
1. intro
\\
2. some more details and intuition on how we see triangulated manifolds as n-cats
\\
3. state sums
\\
4. 2d examples
\\
5. 3d examples
\\
6. connection with orbifold data
\\
7. categorical fields and their connection to state sums

\section{Introduction} \label{s:introduction}

Oriented Pachner theorem is in proposition 3.3 in \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.06085.pdf}
Anibal:  don't they only prove it branched
Lukas: I think this implies oriented
